# Kosuke Takagi  
### One of my goal: To be a full-stack Web developer.  
I am trying to be a web developer with what I learned about web development.

I am seeking a web developer position where I can leverage my network/server engineering background and my strong curiosity and motivation to study web development techniques especially JS(React) and PHP(Laravel) in order to build impressive and attractive web services. 


### If you see `Projects` section in [my profile web site](https://portfolio-typescript-omega.vercel.app/), you will tell what I can.
