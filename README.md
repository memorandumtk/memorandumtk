# Kosuke Takagi  
### I really want to be Back-end Web depeloper in the future.  
#### I like both sides of Javascript though, especially since I feel comfortable when touching the backend site of Javascript.
- Of course, I’m currently learning Javascript. Now I am at the beginning of learning programming so I am going to continue to know Javascript deeply first.  

### I put here the projects that I poured my power into the most.  
1. ***URL Shortener Microservice***
- This is a problem of the backend Javascript course provided by freeCodeCamp
- This was my first time creating API, which is combined with DB, by myself. So I was pretty struggling though, It was worth it!
- [On Github](https://github.com/memorandumtk/urlShorter_express)
2. ***Timer Project***
- This project is also a problem provided by freeCodeCamp.
- In this project, I used almost only React to render and function this project's page.
- [On Github](https://github.com/memorandumtk/freecodecamp_react/tree/main/my-timer)
- [On Codepen](https://codepen.io/memorandum-tk/pen/eYbxXXE)
